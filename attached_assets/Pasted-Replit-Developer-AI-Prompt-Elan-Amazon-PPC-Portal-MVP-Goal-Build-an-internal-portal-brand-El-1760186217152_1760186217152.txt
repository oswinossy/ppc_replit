Replit Developer AI Prompt — Elan Amazon PPC Portal (MVP)

Goal: Build an internal portal (brand: Elan) to visualize Amazon PPC performance and generate per-search-term bid recommendations to target 20% ACOS. Data already lives in Supabase:

sp_search_terms_daily_from22-09-2025 (search-term daily metrics)

sp_placement_daily_v2 (placement daily metrics: TOS/ROS/PP)

Keep it simple (no Amazon API writes). UX similar to M19.
